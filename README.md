## Run Locally

Note that you need [Typst](https://typst.app/) (LaTeX alternative) to generate PDFs from source.

On macOS (with homebrew installed) simply run the following.
```bash
brew install typst
```

Then, to compile from source, clone the repository and run the commands below, with the appropriate filename of course.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/techboy-coder/ethz-cheatsheets
typst compile <file.typ>
```

Open in your favorite text editor and use/modify however you like.
